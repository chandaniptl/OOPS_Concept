📘 OOPS-PROJECT — JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming

This project demonstrates the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using JavaScript. Each OOP concept is organized into a separate folder with practical code examples and supporting visuals.

✅ 1. Constructor
🔹 Definition:

A constructor is a special method used for initializing new objects created from a class. It sets initial values for the object’s properties.

✅ 2. Inheritance
🔹 Definition:

Inheritance allows a class (called the child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (called the parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability and logical structure.

✅ 3. Polymorphism
🔹 Definition:

Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows different classes to define methods with the same name but different behavior. This is typically achieved using method overriding.

✅ 4. Abstraction
🔹 Definition:

Abstraction hides internal implementation details and exposes only essential features to the user. It simplifies code usage and enhances security by preventing direct access to internals.

✅ (Optional) 5. Encapsulation (Suggested addition)
🔹 Definition:

Encapsulation is the process of bundling the data (variables) and the code (methods) that acts on the data into a single unit, often a class. It helps restrict direct access to some components, often using closures or private fields.

📦 This concept is implemented in the Encapsulation/script.js file.
🔚 Summary
Concept	Purpose
Constructor	Initializes object properties
Inheritance	Allows reuse of code via parent-child class relationship
Polymorphism	Enables different behavior for the same method across multiple classes
Abstraction	Hides complex implementation from the user
Encapsulation	Protects internal object state from unintended changes
